**The Infinite Blasebox** is an infinite Blaseball season. It's named after [The Infinite Jukebox](https://eternalbox.dev/jukebox_index.html) (now The Eternal Jukebox), but doesn't really work like it. Instead it contains a (not-yet-faithful) reimplementation of the Blaseball sim, which runs on your computer to generate all the Blaseball games you could desire.

Goals for this project include making the sim much more faithful to the original, most importantly by using the formulas derived by SIBR, allowing configuration of season (and perhaps individual features, like weathers), configurable seeds, major code improvements, and, as a stretch goal, synchronized links so you and a few hundred of your closest friends can all watch the games together. Also, more commas.

Help welcome! Particular areas that need help right now are code organization (it's bad!) and the aforementioned SIBR formulas. You can find me in the issues here or in the #projects channel in [SIBR's discord server](https://discord.gg/cNWgysR2jb).
